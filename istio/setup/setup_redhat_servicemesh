1. Installation via Operator
   After install ElasticSearch, Jaeger, RHSM, start deploy Control Plane from the Web console
   a. Create a project istio-system
   b. Navigate to Operators â†’ Installed Operators. 
   	   Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator. Under Provided APIs, the Operator provides 
   	   links to create two resource types:
    		A ServiceMeshControlPlane resource
    		A ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource 
   c. Under Istio Service Mesh Control Plane click Create ServiceMeshControlPlane.
   d. On the Create Service Mesh Control Plane page, modify the YAML for the default 
      ServiceMeshControlPlane template as needed. 
   e. Click the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane tab. 
   f. Click the name of the new control plane. 
   g. Click the Resources tab to see the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh control plane resources 
      the Operator created and configured. 
      
2. Install via Command Line
	oc new-project istio-system
	oc create -n istio-system -f istio-installation.yaml
	# check the status for istio-system:
	oc get smcp -n istio-system
	# watch the progress of the Pods during the installation process: 
	oc get pods -n istio-system -w
	
3. Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh member roll

	The ServiceMeshMemberRoll lists the projects belonging to the control plane. Only projects listed in 
the ServiceMeshMemberRoll are affected by the control plane. A project does not belong to a service mesh 
until you add it to the member roll for a particular control plane deployment.

 You must create a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource named "default" in the same project as the 
 ServiceMeshControlPlane.
 
     a. Create Member roll
      oc create -n istio-system -f servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml
     b. Create Members
      oc policy add-role-to-user -n <control-plane-namespace> --role-namespace <control-plane-namespace> mesh-user <user-name>
     
    or edit servicememberroll
      oc edit smmr -n isto-system
    
4. Updating application pods
   oc patch deployment/<deployment> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt": "'`date -Iseconds`'"}}}}}'
